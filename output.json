{"sentiment": "negative", "text": "Do not be tempted by less expensive models.  If you are buying Play1's for surround sound, these are the speaker stands for you.  As others have already stated, the base is very heavy, which will keep them from tipping.  Easily assembled, clear instructions.  They come with rubber pads that screw into the base if to be used on hardwood or tile flooring.  For carpets, the little feet come to a fine point.  These stands are very well engineered.  With the cord cover, you don't see any exposed wires, they are very sleek.  You will be proud to have these in your living room.", "title": "Need speaker stand for Sonos Play1,  Don't look any further!"},

{"sentiment": "positive", "text": "I really love the look of these and they were exactly what I needed to get my speakers off the floor and at the same height in my office... they also work 95% of the time with no issues. However, on certain types of songs, at a decent volume, the screws that go into my sonos play 1 units (the thick screws) cause a rattling sound. I've tried putting tape and various other cushioning devices on either side of the holder and almost got it to work.... but not quite. As a result, my speakers are back on the floor and these are going out on the curb... not a great result for the price. FWIW, songs which seem to trigger this for me are ambient/classical with a combination of hi and low frequencies playing at the same time, at a pretty high volume (\"September Song\" by Agnes Obel, for instance).", "title": "Cool design but RATTLE under certain conditions"},
{"sentiment": "positive", "text": "These stands are very well made and were easy to assemble. They have nicely weighted bases and seem to be hard to tip over.

{"sentiment": "negative", "text": "This product is garbage and does not work with the Play 3 as advertised. The problem is the play 3 cable does not detach or latch flat.

{"sentiment": "positive", "text": "Kind of a pain to set up with PLAY:3 speakers, but it sort of works.  Not sure why exactly they even list that as a compatibility, when clearly they were made as a perfect integration with PLAY:1's.

{"sentiment": "positive", "text": "I have set up a few clients homes with different stands for SONOS products. I bought these for my personal home. These stands are sleek and have a heavy base making them very sturdy. The back angle of the stand matches the recline of my sofa so the lines  are visually appealing as opposed to a vertical upright. I originally had my Play:1's on side tables which puts the speakers too low and too far forward.
